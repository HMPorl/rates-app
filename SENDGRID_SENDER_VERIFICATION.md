# SendGrid Sender Identity Verification Guide
## Fixing the "From address does not match a verified Sender Identity" Error

---

## 🚨 **The Problem**
SendGrid requires all "From" email addresses to be verified before sending emails. This is an anti-spam measure.

**Error Message:**
```
(550, b'The from address does not match a verified Sender Identity. Mail cannot be sent until this error is resolved.')
```

## ✅ **Solution: Verify Your Sender Identity**

### **Step 1: Go to SendGrid Console**
1. Visit [SendGrid Console](https://app.sendgrid.com/)
2. Log in with your SendGrid credentials

### **Step 2: Navigate to Sender Authentication**
1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Sender Authentication**
3. You'll see two options:
   - **Single Sender Verification** (Quick & Easy)
   - **Domain Authentication** (Professional)

2. `noreply@thehireman.co.uk` (if you want automated look)
3. `admin@thehireman.co.uk` (if it exists)
